## LangGraph Course Assignment for MAT496

This repository documents my progress through Modules 1 of the LangGraph course, fulfilling the requirements for video-by-video commits, learning summaries, and unique code examples.

## MODULE 1

### LESSON 1: Motivation
 - **Learned:** I've learned the fundamental motivation for using LangGraph to build more powerful and reliable AI agents, need to move beyond single LLM calls. This lesson showed the basics of how LangGraph gives the control to create complex, multi-step workflows, setting the stage for what we will learn in the next few lessons.
 - **Source Code:** No code was provided to edit.

 ### LESSON 2: Simple Graph
 - **Learned:** I learned I can control which path the graph takes just by changing the logic in a decision step. I also learned the final message is built piece by piece with each node adding its own specific words to the story.
 - **Tweak:** I tweaked the random probability to control the path and changed the node text to a new weather theme.
